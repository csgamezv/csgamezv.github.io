						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something new I learned from this article is what stylesheets where. I had not really thought about
								them or even known that it is used but from the examples that were shown by the author it gives a 
								good sense of how the fonts, sizes, and colors mix and match. It looks like it also good to determine
								whether your choices are actually good or if they need some work.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was seeing the different examples of different fonts being used. 
								I found all of the images asthetically pleasing and would like to see my work emulate those designs.
								My favorite image was the little tokyo as I found the choise of font perfect for the picture in the background.
