        <p>Hi my name is Cesar and I like to try new things all of the time! Whether it is learning about something new
            or making a new dish, I always find it exciting to do new things. Apart from that, some of my hobbies are, 
            Basketball, football, mariachi, and going to the gym.

            <ul>
                <li>1. Something I learned from this article is that I can learn how to design apps better by just looking
                    at more apps with intention to how they are designed. I never really payed attention to how apps are 
                    made and that they probably take a lot more thought of audience interactions to design one. 
                </li>
                <li>2. My favorite part of the article is when she delves into commonly seen designs in social media.
                    It shows the intention of the people that designed it and what you have to think
                     about when making a website </li>
                <li>3."You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product."</li>
